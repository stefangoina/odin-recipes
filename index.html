      <p>Hi guys,let's talk a bit about this projectðŸ˜Š</p>
      <p>
        It is my first project now during the TOP learning journey and I'm
        really excited about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's it about? Well this page is the main page which will contain
        anchor hyperlink references to another pages that will contain recipes
        and how to make them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's get to it, please click on any of the links below which sound
        <b>more delicious</b> to you.ðŸ˜„
      </p>
      <p>
        Update: Got in some CSS to improve the styling of the page. As a task
        from TOP , I implemented some box-models work around here and there for
        practice.
