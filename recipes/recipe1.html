    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>300 g minced veal</li>
      <li>200 g shallots</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>3 tbsp mustard</li>
      <li>50 g capers</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step-by-step Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Finely chop the shallots, e.g. using a food processor. Fry gently in
        olive oil in a frying pan until the shallot pieces have softened; they
        must not, however, turn brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the fried shallots with the minced veal, the eggs, the mustard, the
        capers and some salt and pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover a plate with a thin film of olive oil. Transfer the meat mixture
        from the bowl to the plate and form it into an oversized burger with the
        same diameter as the frying pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the burger slide from the plate into the heated frying pan. Fry for
        about 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the frying pan from the heat. Put the plate on top of it. Turn
        frying pan and plate upside down so that the burger will end up on the
        plate. Take another plate, cover it with a film of olive oil. put it on
        top of the plate with the burger, turn the two plates upside down.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should now have the burger on the second plate with the fried side
        up. Let it slide back into the frying pan. Fry the burger for another 4
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the burger in two halves and serve together with, e.g. mashed
        potatoes and a salad.
      </li>
